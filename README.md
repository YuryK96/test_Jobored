Test Project when i implemented getting and updating the token, receiving and displaying vacancies and categories from the server.
Added filtering, filter validation, pagination and searching, subloading for vacancies. User can also add and remove vacancies in favorite.
Favorite vacancies are stored in local storage and saved after site reloads. I made adaptive markup for tablet/mobile.

The main technology stack is: React.js, Redux-toolkit, redux-thunk, react-hook-form, scss, TS.
